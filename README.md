# redux-basics

This is the simplest demo of redux I have seen. It is very useful. It demonstrates redux - just using node - not react.

Run npm install to install node then run node redux-basics on your terminal application to run file.


contains a state object, create store function, some dispatched actions and a reducer and a subscribe to store function
